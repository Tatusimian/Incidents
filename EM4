Dear HR,

I am writing to bring to your attention a series of events that have taken place at my workplace recently. This is my fourth attempt to reach out to Human Resources regarding this matter, as my previous three attempts have been unsuccessful in getting a response.

On Monday, March 10th, I noticed that two of my scheduled shifts for the week (Wednesday and Thursday) had been removed from the schedule without my knowledge. I reached out to my manager, Miles, who informed me that Jack had made changes to the schedule and that he would try to get one of the days back for me. Miles was able to get my Wednesday shift back, but I was still off on Thursday.

On Friday, I was informed by another manager, Caitlin, that the decision to cut my two shifts had come from corporate, and that Jack had made these decisions without consulting Miles or any other managers. I am concerned about the lack of transparency and communication in this situation, and I feel that it is important to address these issues.

I am hoping that this email will be addressed promptly, as I am eager to find a resolution to this situation.
