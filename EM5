**Workplace Events Documentation**

**Event #1: Shift Schedule Change Notification and Follow-Up**
- **Date & Time**: Yesterday at 3:00 PM
- **Location**: Workplace entrance and inside the store
- **Individuals Involved**: Coworker, Shift Lead: Caitlin, Upper Corporate Personnel: Jack (not present, mentioned in conversation), Kitchen Manager: Miles, Floor Manager: Jade
- **Event Description**: Upon arrival at work, encountered coworker and shift lead Caitlin outside the building. Caitlin informed that Jack, a member of the upper corporate team, had altered the work schedule, resulting in a reduction of shifts for the current week.
- **Personal Reaction**: The news was surprising and shocking, with no prior warnings, evaluations, counseling sessions, or corrective actions communicated regarding any accusations. The lack of explanation for the sudden reduction in hours left unprepared and seeking clarity.
- **Subsequent Actions**: Entered the store and informed Miles, the kitchen manager, about the schedule change. Miles expressed shock, surprise, and anger. Reported the situation to Jade, the floor manager, who was also surprised as she had not been previously informed about the decision. Jade committed to conducting an inquiry to gather more information.
- **Additional Information**: Both Miles and Jade confirmed that there were no documented emails or communications addressing any performance issues. The general manager, Joey, was also uninformed about any potential issues that could have led to the disciplinary action taken by Jack. The schedule for Wednesday was restored, and the future schedule has been returned to its original state. However, there was no direct communication from Jack or corporate regarding the resolution or the initial issue.

**Event #2: Conversation with Shift Lead Caitlin - Additional Notes**
- **Date & Time**: Later that evening at 9:00 PM
- **Location**: Back of house's dishwashing station
- **Individuals Involved**: Shift Lead: Caitlin
- **Event Description**: Initiated a conversation with Caitlin to discuss the confidentiality of employee-related information within management. Expressed concerns about the appropriateness of sharing sensitive information regarding other employees' business when they are not directly involved. Highlighted that such actions by upper management could be indicative of underlying intentions.
- **Caitlin's Reaction**: Caitlin became defensive, visibly shaken, and upset by the conversation. She insisted that future interactions remain strictly professional and that any further discussions about the situation would require another manager's presence.
- **My Response**: Clarified that the intention was not to upset her but to inform her about the potential implications of upper management's actions. Offered an apology, which Caitlin deflected.
- **Personal Reflections**: Emphasized that Caitlin is not held responsible for her reaction. Grateful to Caitlin for sharing the information about the schedule changes. Regarded Caitlin as a confidential work partner with great respect and admiration. The decisions made by Jack have negatively affected the relationship with Caitlin, contributing to a sense of hostility in the workplace. The actions taken by Jack appear to contravene company protocols and are difficult to comprehend without attributing hostile intentions.

**Event #3: Confirmation from Floor Manager Jade**
- **Date & Time**: That evening at 10:30 PM
- **Location**: Exiting the store
- **Individuals Involved**: Floor Manager: Jade
- **Event Description**: Spoke with Jade on the way out of the store. Jade confirmed that what Miles said was true and accurate. There were no emails whatsoever that addressed any behavioral issues. No communication from corporate to the store and that Joey, the general manager, was completely unaware that the hours being cut were designed or meant to be some type of disciplinary action for supposed accusations of performance issues.

   - You were preparing red onions soaked in a lime juice marinade.
   - Due to the rush, you forgot to use the mandolin for uniform cutting.
   - After adding lime juice, you realized there might not be enough.
   - Seeking guidance, you approached the owner, Jason, who directed you to the cookbook.

2. **Response and Reporting**:

   - You composed an email to human resources outlining the situation.

3. **Subsequent Interaction with Jason**:

   - Jason claimed he was typically quiet but blamed you for idle conversations during food prep.
   - He subtly apologized and emphasized professionalism.
   - When you reminded him of his unprofessional reaction, he suggested seeking employment elsewhere.

**Reflection**:
- The power dynamics between ownership and employees are evident.
- Jason's behavior and double standards raise valid concerns.
- His suggestion to find employment elsewhere felt ominous and unfair.
