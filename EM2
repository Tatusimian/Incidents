Dear Human Resources,
I am writing to follow up on my previous correspondence regarding the incident that occurred on [June 7th]. Since then, I have had a conversation with Jason, the owner, about what happened. Before offering an apology, he mentioned that he was aware I had contacted human resources, which I perceived as an indication of the power dynamic within the company.
While he acknowledged some responsibility for his response, I felt that his apology was minimal and nested within a lot of padding that seemed designed to place the blame on me.
During our conversation, he mentioned that the company was trying to become more professional. However, when I gently reminded him that his response to me was not professional, he reacted by saying, "If you don't like it, you can always find another place to work." He then implied that his behavior was acceptable because he was "old school."
I am concerned that these actions, including the use of gaslighting tactics and minimizing his responsibility, are not in line with the company's values and policies. Additionally, the atmosphere created by this incident has left me feeling uneasy and uncertain about the company's commitment to a positive and respectful work environment.
I also feel that the conflict of interest with Jason being in charge of both the restaurant and human resources could hinder a fair and impartial investigation."
